\title{Infers ethnicity using DNA methylation microarray data}
\usage{
pl_infer_ethnicity(betas, threshold = 0.75)
}
\arguments{
\item{betas}{n x m dataframe of methylation values on the beta scale (0, 1), where the variables
are arranged in rows, and samples in columns. Should contain all 1860 predictors and be
normalized with NOOB and BMIQ.}

\item{threshold}{A probability threshold ranging from (0, 1) to call samples 'ambiguous'.
Defaults to 0.75.}
}
\value{
A m x 7 dataframe of predicted ethnicity information and associated probabilities.
}
\description{
\code{pl_infer_ethnicity} Uses a glmnet model to predict ethnicity using DNA methylation data.
}
\details{
Predicts self-reported ethnicity from 3 classes: Africans, Asians, and Caucasians, using
placental DNA methylation data measured on the Infinium 450k/EPIC methylation array. Will return
membership probabilities that often reflect genetic ancestry composition.

The input data should contain all 1860 predictors (cpgs) of the final GLMNET model.

It's recommended to use the same normalization methods used on the training data: NOOB and BMIQ.
